The Center for High Throughput Computing provides large-scale computational 
resources to researchers on campus who require computing to do their work.  
This training provides an introduction to what high throughput computing is 
and how to start using CHTC's high throughput computing resources.  

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This training assumes that you already have a basic knowledge of shell commands 
> to create, edit, and move files and directories, as well as how to navigate 
> a filesystem using commands like `cd` and `ls`.
